<h1>Adding styles to a webpage</h1>

The look of a webpage can be changed by using css (cascading style sheets) these link elements of your webpage to styles where rules are put in place to change the appearance. Stylesheets allow consistent styling across multiple pages as a single rule can be appied multiple times.

STEP1:
Write the content of your webpage. Put the content withing divider tags. These will allow you to target specific elements in your page. There’s an example page along with this repo.

STEP2:
Add a style tag to the head of your webpage. You can either add the style rules directly to the webpage or reference a separate webpage.

<code><link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='styles.css"/></code>

STEP3:
Add a text document named styles.css add the following snippet to the top of the document:

<code>
p {
  font-size:24px;
  font-family:arial;
}
</code>

the code will change the styles of all instances of a p tag in your document.

STEP4:
Launch the webpage ether through a localhost or by opening the index.html page in a browser.
